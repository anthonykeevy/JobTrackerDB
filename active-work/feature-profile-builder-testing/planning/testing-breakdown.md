# Profile Builder Testing - Task Breakdown

## Overview
Systematic testing of all Profile Builder steps to ensure stability and real functionality. Each sub-task will be a focused feature with clear deliverables.

## Profile Builder Steps Analysis
Based on current implementation:

1. **WelcomeStep** - Mode selection (Guided vs Independent)
2. **ResumeUploadStep** - Drag-and-drop with AI parsing simulation
3. **BasicInfoStep** - Comprehensive form with address validation
4. **CareerAspirationStep** - Current/future titles, industries, work preferences
5. **EducationStep** - Tabbed interface with certifications
6. **WorkExperienceStep** - Multiple experiences with achievements
7. **SkillsStep** - 4 categories with proficiency levels
8. **ProjectsStep** - Portfolio showcase with technology tags
9. **ReviewStep** - Comprehensive profile summary

## Proposed Task Breakdown Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation Testing (2-3 tasks)**
Focus on core infrastructure and navigation that all steps depend on.

### **Phase 2: Individual Step Testing (8-9 tasks)**
Each step gets its own focused testing task to ensure isolation and clarity.

### **Phase 3: Integration Testing (2-3 tasks)**
End-to-end workflows and cross-step data flow validation.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features Testing (2-3 tasks)**
Address validation, form validation, responsive design, etc.
