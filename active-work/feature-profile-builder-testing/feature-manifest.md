# Feature Manifest: Profile Builder Testing

## Overview
- **Epic**: EPC-1 (Career Profile Intake)
- **Story ID**: EPC-1.TESTING
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Planning
- **Created**: 2025-01-08
- **Updated**: 2025-01-08

## Scope
- **CRITICAL**: Data persistence with audit trails for all profile data
- Systematic testing of all 9 Profile Builder steps with database integration
- End-to-end workflow validation with data persistence
- Backend integration verification with audit trails
- Performance and stability testing
- Address validation deep testing with database storage
- Mobile responsiveness validation

## Dependencies
### Upstream Dependencies
- Profile Builder components (completed)
- Backend API structure (partially complete)
- Address validation frontend (completed)

### Downstream Impacts
- Address validation backend integration
- User onboarding experience
- Database schema validation
- API endpoint reliability

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **External**: Geoscape API, OpenAI API

## Testing Strategy
### Phase 1: Foundation Testing (Tasks 1.1-1.2)
- Core infrastructure and navigation
- Form validation framework

### Phase 2: Individual Step Testing (Tasks 2.1-2.9)
- Each of the 9 profile steps tested individually
- Isolated testing for clear bug identification

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Tasks 3.1-3.3)
- End-to-end workflows
- Backend integration
- Data persistence

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Tasks 4.1-4.3)
- Address validation deep testing
- Responsive design and accessibility
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 9 profile steps tested and functional
- [ ] Complete profile creation workflow works end-to-end
- [ ] Backend integration stable and reliable
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design verified across devices
- [ ] Address validation integrated with real API
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards (< 3s load times)
- [ ] All critical bugs identified and fixed
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings

## Cross-Feature Relationships
- **Data Dependencies**: Profile schema, address validation
- **API Dependencies**: Resume upload, address validation, profile CRUD
- **UI Dependencies**: Form components, navigation, responsive design

## Implementation Notes
- Break down into 17 focused sub-tasks
- Each task should be its own feature workspace
- Follow systematic testing approach
- Document all findings and fixes
- Regular cleanup after each task

## Files to be Tested
### Frontend Files
- ProfileBuilder/index.tsx (main component)
- ProfileBuilder/steps/*.tsx (all 9 steps)
- ProfileBuilder/types.ts (type definitions)
- Map/MapComponent.tsx (address validation)

### Backend Files
- API endpoints for profile management
- Database models and validation
- Address validation services

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk
- Address validation API integration
- Backend data persistence
- Cross-step data flow

### Medium Risk
- Mobile responsiveness
- Form validation edge cases
- Performance under load

## Cleanup Checklist
- [ ] All sub-tasks completed
- [ ] Feature documentation created
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Test results archived
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Bug fixes integrated into project-core
