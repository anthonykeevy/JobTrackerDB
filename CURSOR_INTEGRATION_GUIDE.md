# 🎯 Cursor Integration Guide for JobTrackerDB

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your issue with Cursor not recognizing the Backend and Frontend services has been resolved. Here's what I've implemented:

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. **Root package.json with Concurrent Scripts**
- Added `concurrently` package to run both services in one terminal
- Created npm scripts: `dev`, `dev:backend`, `dev:frontend`
- Added utility scripts for process management

### 2. **Multiple Startup Options**
- **npm scripts** (recommended for Cursor)
- **PowerShell script** (`dev-setup.ps1`)
- **Batch file** (`start-dev.bat`)

### 3. **Process Management**
- Automatic port conflict resolution
- Easy service stopping with `Ctrl+C`
- Process cleanup utilities

## 🚀 How to Use with Cursor

### **Option 1: npm scripts (Best for Cursor)**
```bash
# In Cursor's integrated terminal:
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: PowerShell script**
```powershell
# In Cursor's integrated terminal:
.\dev-setup.ps1 dev
```

### **Option 3: Batch file**
```bash
# In Cursor's integrated terminal:
start-dev.bat
```

## 🎯 Benefits for Cursor

### ✅ **Single Terminal Session**
- Both services run in the same terminal Cursor can monitor
- No more separate PowerShell sessions
- Cursor can see all output from both services

### ✅ **Process Visibility**
- Cursor can see both backend and frontend processes
- All logs appear in Cursor's integrated terminal
- Easy to stop both services with `Ctrl+C`

### ✅ **Auto-reload**
- Both services reload automatically on file changes
- Changes are reflected immediately
- No manual restart needed

### ✅ **Error Handling**
- All errors appear in Cursor's terminal
- Better debugging experience
- Consistent logging format

## 📊 Current Status

**✅ Both services are running:**
- **Backend**: http://127.0.0.1:8000 ✅
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start both services
npm run dev:backend      # Start only backend
npm run dev:frontend     # Start only frontend

# Process Management
npm run kill:ports       # Kill all processes
npm run clean            # Clean cache

# Dependencies
npm run install:all      # Install all dependencies
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If services don't start:
```bash
npm run kill:ports
npm run dev
```

### If you get module errors:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### If you need to clean cache:
```bash
npm run clean
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

**Cursor can now:**
- ✅ Monitor both backend and frontend services
- ✅ See all logs and errors in one terminal
- ✅ Control both services from the integrated terminal
- ✅ Auto-reload both services on file changes
- ✅ Stop both services with a single `Ctrl+C`

**No more separate PowerShell sessions needed!** 🎯
