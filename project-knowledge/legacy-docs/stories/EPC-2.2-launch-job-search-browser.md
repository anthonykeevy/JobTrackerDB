### User Story JD.29 – Support Job Logging Audit Trail for Transparency and Reuse

**As a** system  
**I want** to maintain a complete audit trail of each user’s job logging journey  
**So that** we can ensure data traceability, improve deduplication, and enhance reuse by other users

---

**Description:**  
This story ensures that every interaction a user has while logging a job—from their first click on a job board to the final structured data confirmation—is fully logged and versioned. These logs help in diagnosing errors, tracing data lineage, understanding job sourcing behavior, and evaluating fit score version dependencies. They also support gamification and allow other users to trust existing job data.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System logs the user’s full navigation chain: initial board, redirects, final job URL
- [ ] System records browser metadata (e.g., timestamp, referrer URLs, user agent)
- [ ] All user edits and confirmations to the job log are timestamped and stored
- [ ] Job entries are linked to their job version and job board metadata
- [ ] Users can view their own job log history in a traceable format
- [ ] Admins can view audit trails for support and moderation
- [ ] Audit trail enables system to show “trusted by X users” status for reused job logs

---

**Dependencies:**
- Navigation tracking system from browser control layer
- JobLog schema with change history and timestamping
- Linkage to JobBoard and JobVersion tables
- UI display for user and admin audit trace

**Priority:** High  
**Tags:** audit-trail, traceability, reuse-confidence, logging-history, user-transparency
