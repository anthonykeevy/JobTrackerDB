# FE.2: Responsive Design System

**Epic:** Epic 13 â€“ Frontend Architecture & UI/UX

**As a** user accessing the platform from any device,  
I want to **have a consistent and optimized experience across all screen sizes**,  
So that **I can use the platform effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**.

   - Desktop: 1024px - 1440px
   - Large desktop: 1440px+
   - Consistent breakpoint usage across components
   - Fluid typography and spacing

3. Design tokens and variables:
   - CSS custom properties for colors, typography, spacing
   - Consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
   - Typography scale with responsive font sizes
   - Color palette with semantic naming
   - Border radius and shadow standards

4. Component library responsiveness:
   - All components adapt to different screen sizes
   - Flexible layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Responsive images and media
   - Collapsible navigation and menus

7. Performance optimization:
   - Responsive images with srcset and sizes
   - Lazy loading for images and components
   - Optimized assets for different screen densities
   - Reduced bundle size for mobile
   - Network-aware loading strategies

8. Cross-device testing:
   - Testing on real devices and browsers
   - Emulator testing for various screen sizes
   - Performance testing on different devices
