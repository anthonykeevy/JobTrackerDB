# QA.2: Integration Testing

**Epic:** Epic 12 â€“ Testing & Quality Assurance

**As a** developer working on the platform,  
I want to **test how different components work together**,  
So that **I can ensure the system functions correctly as a whole and identify integration issues early**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API integration testing:
   - End-to-end API testing with real database
   - Complete request/response cycle testing
   - API authentication and authorization flows
   - Error handling and recovery testing
   - API versioning and backward compatibility

2. Frontend-backend integration:
   - Full user journey testing from UI to database
   - State synchronization testing
   - Real-time updates and notifications
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Performance under realistic load

3. Database integration testing:
   - Real database transactions and rollbacks
   - Data consistency and integrity testing
   - Concurrent access and locking testing
   - Database migration and schema updates
   - Backup and recovery procedures

4. Third-party service integration:
   - OpenAI API integration testing
   - Email service integration testing
   - External job board API testing
   - Payment processing integration (future)
   - Service failure and fallback testing

5. Authentication and security integration:
   - Complete authentication flow testing
   - Session management and timeout testing
   - Role-based access control testing
   - Security token validation
   - Password reset and recovery flows

6. Data flow integration:
   - Profile creation to job matching flow
   - Job logging to fit score calculation
   - Resume generation to export pipeline
   - Notification trigger to delivery
   - Analytics data collection and processing

7. Performance integration testing:
   - End-to-end performance under load
   - Database query performance with real data
   - API response times under concurrent users
   - Memory usage and resource consumption
   - Scalability testing with increasing load

8. Error handling and recovery:
   - System failure recovery testing
   - Partial service failure handling
   - Data corruption and recovery
   - Network interruption handling
   - Graceful degradation testing

## Definition of Done

- Third-party integrations are reliable
- Performance meets established benchmarks
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Security integrations are properly tested
- Recovery procedures work as expected
