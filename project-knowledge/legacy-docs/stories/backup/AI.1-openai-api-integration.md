# AI.1: OpenAI API Integration

**Epic:** Epic 14 â€“ AI Service Integration

**As a** developer integrating AI services,  
I want to **securely and efficiently integrate OpenAI APIs**,  
So that **the platform can provide intelligent features while maintaining security and cost control**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API key management:
   - Secure storage of API keys in environment variables
   - API key rotation and management procedures
   - Access control and permission management
   - Key usage monitoring and alerting
   - Backup and recovery procedures

2. Request/response handling:
   - Robust error handling for API failures
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Request timeout and cancellation
   - Response validation and parsing
   - Rate limiting and quota management

3. Token usage tracking:
   - Real-time token consumption monitoring
   - Per-user and per-feature token tracking
   - Cost calculation and allocation
   - Usage analytics and reporting
   - Budget limits and alerts

4. Model selection and optimization:
   - Appropriate model selection for different tasks
   - Model performance comparison and optimization
   - Cost-effective model usage strategies
   - Model version management
   - Fallback model options

5. Security and privacy:
   - Data encryption in transit and at rest
   - User data anonymization for API calls
   - Secure API key handling
   - Privacy compliance for AI interactions
   - Audit logging for AI service usage

6. Performance optimization:
   - Request caching and optimization
   - Batch processing for multiple requests
   - Async processing for long-running tasks
   - Response streaming for large outputs
   - Performance monitoring and alerting

7. Error handling and recovery:
   - Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Fallback to non-AI alternatives
   - Service health monitoring

8. Integration with platform features:
   - Seamless integration with resume generation
   - Job matching and analysis features
   - Skill inference and recommendations
   - Content optimization and enhancement
   - User feedback and improvement loops
