# FE.1: React SPA Architecture

**Epic:** Epic 13 â€“ Frontend Architecture & UI/UX

**As a** frontend developer,  
I want to **set up a modern React SPA architecture with TypeScript**,  
So that **I can build a scalable, maintainable, and performant user interface**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React application setup:
   - React 18+ with TypeScript configuration
   - Vite build tool for fast development and building
   - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Hot module replacement for development
   - Production build optimization

2. Component architecture:
   - Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
   - Reusable component structure
   - Props interface definitions with TypeScript
   - Component composition patterns
   - Custom hooks for shared logic

3. State management:
   - React Context for global state
   - Custom hooks for local state management
   - State persistence and hydration
   - State synchronization across components
   - Optimistic updates and error handling

4. Routing and navigation:
   - React Router for client-side routing
   - Route protection and authentication guards
   - Nested routing for complex layouts
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Navigation history and breadcrumbs

5. Progressive disclosure patterns:
   - Step-by-step workflows for complex tasks
   - Collapsible sections and accordions
   - Modal dialogs and overlays
   - Progressive form validation
   - Contextual help and tooltips

6. TypeScript integration:
   - Strict TypeScript configuration
   - Type definitions for all components
   - API response type definitions
   - Utility types and interfaces
   - Type safety for props and state

7. Development tooling:
   - Development server with hot reload
   - Source maps for debugging
   - Environment configuration
   - Build optimization and analysis
   - Development and production builds

8. Performance optimization:
   - Code splitting by routes and components
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
   - Memoization for expensive calculations
   - Bundle size monitoring
   - Performance profiling tools

## Definition of Done

- React application is set up with TypeScript
- Component architecture follows best practices
- State management is properly implemented
- Routing system handles all navigation needs
- Progressive disclosure patterns are implemented
- TypeScript provides full type safety
- Development tooling is efficient and reliable
- Performance optimizations are in place
