# User Story CI.4: MCP Integration

**Epic:** Core Infrastructure & Database  
**Story ID:** CI.4  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

## Description

As a **developer**,  
I want to **implement a custom MCP service for centralized data access and security**,  
So that **all database operations are properly validated, logged, and secured**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MCP service architecture:
   - Custom MCP service implementation
   - Centralized data access layer
   - Service discovery and registration
   - Protocol compliance and standards
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

2. Database operation mediation:
   - All database reads and writes routed through MCP
   - SQL query validation and sanitization
   - Parameterized queries and injection prevention
   - Transaction management and rollback
   - Connection pooling and resource management
   - Query optimization and performance tuning

3. Permission validation and access control:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - User permission validation for all operations
   - Resource-level access control
   - Permission inheritance and delegation
   - Access request and approval workflows
   - Security policy enforcement

4. Audit logging for all operations:
   - Comprehensive audit trail for all database operations
   - User action tracking and logging
   - Data access and modification logging
   - Security event logging and alerting
   - Audit log retention and archival
   - Compliance reporting and analysis

5. Data validation and business logic:
   - Business rule enforcement at the MCP layer
   - Data integrity validation and constraints
   - Cross-reference validation and consistency checks
   - Custom validation rules and workflows
   - Data transformation and normalization
   - Error handling and validation feedback

6. Future client support:
   - Extensible architecture for multiple clients
   - API versioning and backward compatibility
   - Client authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and throttling per client
   - Client-specific data access controls
   - Mobile app and third-party integration support

7. MCP service features:
   - Health monitoring and status reporting
   - Configuration management and updates
   - Service discovery and load balancing
   - Fault tolerance and failover
   - Performance metrics and analytics
   - Security and compliance monitoring
