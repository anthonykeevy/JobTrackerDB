### User Story JD.6 â€“ Show Confirmation and Summary of Job Logging

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** to receive a clear confirmation after logging a job  
**So that** I understand what was saved and how it contributes to my profile and gamification progress

---

**Description:**  
After a job is logged, the system should present a summary screen showing the logged job details, the version status (new or reused), any awarded gamification points, and available next actions (e.g., run fit score, update profile). This reinforces user confidence and guides them to the next valuable step.
