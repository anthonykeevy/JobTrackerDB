# PM.2 - Model-Aware Prompt Mapping

## Goal
Allow prompts to be configured for use with specific AI models and manage compatibility, cost, and performance trade-offs across supported engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each prompt entry can be mapped to one or more AI models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude)
- Admins can define model-specific variations of the same prompt
- The system automatically dispatches the correct version based on selected or default model
- Model–prompt pairs are tracked for each AI invocation
- Model-specific metadata includes:
  - Model name and version
  - Token cost per 1K tokens (input/output)
  - Rate limits or quotas
- A prompt compatibility matrix is visible in the admin console
- Admins can assign fallback prompts for unsupported or failed model interactions
- A warning is shown if a prompt is not optimized or tested for a given model
- Logs link every model–prompt combo to performance metrics and user feedback
