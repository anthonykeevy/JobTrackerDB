### User Story JD.4 – Submit and Version Job Record

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** the system to save my logged job and detect if it requires versioning  
**So that** I can contribute to a shared job repository while maintaining the accuracy of my personalized fit score

---

**Description:**  
Once the user confirms job details, the system should submit the job record. If the content matches an existing job (within defined similarity threshold), it links the user to the shared entry. If user-edited content introduces differences that may affect downstream fit scoring (e.g., new responsibilities or qualifications), a new version of the job should be created and timestamped. The system logs these decisions with full traceability.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Job submissions are checked for content similarity using hashing or semantic comparison
- [ ] If matched, the user is linked to the existing job entry
- [ ] If substantial changes are made, a new job version is created
- [ ] Version metadata includes: user, timestamp, parent job reference, reason for versioning
- [ ] Cosmetic or metadata-only edits do not trigger versioning (e.g., corrected industry or formatting)
- [ ] System prompts the user with a summary of the submission outcome (e.g., “Linked to existing job” or “New version created”)

---

**Dependencies:**
- Job repository schema with version control
- Similarity analysis engine (hash-based and/or semantic diff)
- Logging and traceability mechanisms

---

**Priority:** High  
**Tags:** version-control, deduplication, job-repository, traceability, user-linkage
