### User Story JD.3 â€“ Extract and Confirm Job Details

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** the system to extract and prefill job details from the job page I am viewing  
**So that** I can quickly verify and log the job with minimal manual effort

---

**Description:**  
Once the user identifies a job of interest during the browser session, the system should extract key job details from the page using AI/NLP or DOM parsing. The user will be presented with a structured preview of the extracted information and can confirm or edit it before submission. If a similar job already exists, the user should be notified and optionally link to it or create a personalized version.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Job data extraction includes: title, company name, full description, job URL, and application board path
- [ ] Extracted details are shown in a structured preview for user confirmation
- [ ] User can edit any of the fields before submission
- [ ] System checks for existing similar job records and offers reuse or version creation options
- [ ] User can override metadata (e.g., industry, functional area) if applicable
- [ ] All edits are stored with traceability metadata (user, timestamp, versioned or override)

---

**Dependencies:**
- DOM scraping / NLP model integration
- Job schema and duplicate detection logic
- UI component for data preview and edit
- Logging and version tracking system

---

**Priority:** High  
**Tags:** AI-parsing, data-extraction, job-logging, user-editing, traceability, version-control
