# PM.1 - Prompt Registry & Editor

## Goal
Establish a central, version-controlled repository where administrators can create, edit, organize, and manage AI prompts by feature and usage context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admins can create new prompts and assign them to a feature/component (e.g., resume tuning, skill analysis)
- Prompts can be tagged by function, model compatibility, and use case
- Editing interface includes:
  - Syntax-highlighted editor
  - Description field and change history
  - Metadata: created by, modified by, timestamps
- Each prompt supports versioning:
  - History of edits
  - Version labels (e.g., “prod-v1.2”, “test-v1.3”)
  - Compare versions with diff view
  - Restore or duplicate any prior version
- Prompts can be marked as:
  - Active (in production)
  - Draft (editable)
  - Archived (historical, read-only)
- System prevents editing of locked (production) prompts without clone or admin override
- Integrated search/filter by feature, tag, model compatibility, or version status
