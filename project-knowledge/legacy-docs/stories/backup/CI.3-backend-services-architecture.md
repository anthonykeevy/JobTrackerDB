# User Story CI.3: Backend Services Architecture

**Epic:** Core Infrastructure & Database  
**Story ID:** CI.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

---

## Description

As a **developer**,  
I want to **implement a modular FastAPI-based backend architecture**,  
So that **the platform provides reliable, scalable, and maintainable services**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FastAPI application structure:
   - Modular application architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Dependency injection and service layer pattern
   - Configuration management for different environments
   - Application startup and shutdown procedures
   - Health check endpoints and monitoring
   - Error handling middleware and exception management

2. Authentication and session management:
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Session management with secure cookie handling
   - Password hashing and validation
   - Rate limiting and brute force protection
   - Account lockout and security measures
   - Multi-factor authentication preparation

3. Data validation and sanitization:
   - Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Input sanitization and XSS protection
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Data type validation and conversion
   - Custom validation rules and business logic
   - Error message localization and user-friendly feedback

4. Error handling and logging:
   - Comprehensive error handling middleware
   - Structured logging with different log levels
   - Error tracking and monitoring integration
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Debug information for development
   - Error reporting and alerting

5. Performance optimization and caching:
   - Database connection pooling
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Query optimization and database indexing
   - Response compression and optimization
   - Background task processing with Celery
   - Performance monitoring and metrics

6. Security and encryption services:
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Secure headers and CORS configuration
   - CSRF protection and security middleware
   - API key management and validation
   - Audit logging for security events
   - Privacy and GDPR compliance features

7. Service layer architecture:
   - Business logic separation in service classes
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Unit testing and integration testing
   - Mock services for development
   - Service discovery and dependency management
   - API documentation with automatic generation
