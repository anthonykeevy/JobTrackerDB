### User Story JD.5 – Award Gamification Points for Logging

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** to earn points when I log jobs into the system  
**So that** I stay motivated and feel rewarded for contributing useful job data

---

**Description:**  
The platform should award points based on the completeness of job logs. Fully detailed submissions (title, company, description, source path) earn maximum points, while partial submissions yield partial rewards. Users who enrich shared job entries or confirm deduplication suggestions can also earn collaboration points. All gamification events should be tracked, surfaced in the user dashboard, and tied into overall milestone progression.

- [ ] Full points awarded for logging complete job entries (title, company, description, board source)
- [ ] Partial points awarded for incomplete or metadata-only submissions
