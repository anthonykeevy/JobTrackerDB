### User Story JD.52 – Prompt Verification of Recruiter Employment Transitions

**Epic:** Job Discovery and Logging for Profile Matching  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Ready for Dev  
**Type:** Feature  

**Story:**  
As a system,  
I want to detect when a recruiter appears to have changed employers based on new job logs,  
So that I can prompt a verification process to confirm the recruiter–company transition without compromising historical job data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify potential recruiter–employer changes when job logs conflict with previous employer associations.
- [ ] Initiate a recruiter transition prompt with the detected date range.
- [ ] Allow manual confirmation or override of the recruiter transition.
- [ ] Timestamp confirmed transitions and store in `RecruiterCompanyHistory`.
- [ ] Maintain historical linkage—ensure older job logs retain their original recruiter–company reference.
- [ ] Update UI to reflect pending transitions and verification status.
- [ ] Award gamification points to users who confirm or validate recruiter transitions.
- [ ] Update Epic metadata to reflect transition impact on job versioning and recruiter analytics.
