# EPC-16.2: Subscription Management

**Epic:** Epic 16 - Billing & Payment System  
**Story Owner:** Backend Developer  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 10 hours  
**Status:** Draft  

## User Story

As a user,  
I want to manage my subscription (create, upgrade, downgrade, cancel),  
So that I can control my billing and access to the AI-powered resume and job tracking platform.

## Background

Users need the ability to subscribe to the platform, manage their subscription status, and control their billing. The system must handle subscription lifecycle management including creation, updates, cancellations, and payment failure recovery. This includes prorated billing for mid-cycle changes and grace period handling for failed payments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Subscription Creation**
   - [ ] Users can create new subscriptions with payment method
   - [ ] Subscription is created in Stripe and local database
   - [ ] User access is granted immediately upon successful payment
   - [ ] Welcome email is sent with subscription details

2. **Subscription Updates**
   - [ ] Users can upgrade/downgrade their subscription
   - [ ] Prorated billing is calculated correctly
   - [ ] Changes take effect at next billing cycle
   - [ ] Users are notified of subscription changes

3. **Subscription Cancellation**
   - [ ] Users can cancel their subscription
   - [ ] Option to cancel immediately or at period end
   - [ ] Retention offers are presented during cancellation
   - [ ] Access continues until end of paid period

4. **Payment Failure Handling**
   - [ ] Automatic retry logic for failed payments
   - [ ] Grace period before service suspension
   - [ ] Email notifications for payment issues
   - [ ] Easy payment method update process

5. **Subscription Status Management**
   - [ ] Real-time subscription status tracking
   - [ ] Automatic status updates via webhooks
   - [ ] Service access control based on status
   - [ ] Clear status indicators in user interface

## Technical Requirements

### Subscription Service
```python
class SubscriptionService:
    async def create_subscription(self, user_id: int, payment_method_id: str, 
                                 plan_id: str) -> Subscription:
        # Create Stripe customer
        # Create subscription
        # Update local database
        # Grant user access
        pass
    
    async def update_subscription(self, subscription_id: str, 
                                 new_plan_id: str) -> Subscription:
        # Calculate proration
        # Update Stripe subscription
        # Update local database
        # Notify user
        pass
    
    async def cancel_subscription(self, subscription_id: str, 
                                 cancel_at_period_end: bool = True) -> Subscription:
        # Cancel in Stripe
        # Update local database
        # Handle immediate vs end-of-period cancellation
        pass
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/subscriptions` - Create new subscription
- `GET /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` - Get subscription details
- `PUT /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` - Update subscription
- `DELETE /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` - Cancel subscription
- `POST /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/reactivate` - Reactivate subscription
- `GET /api/subscriptions/user/{userId}` - Get user's subscription

### Business Logic
- Subscription creation requires valid payment method
- Prorated billing for mid-cycle changes
- Grace period of 7 days for failed payments
- Service access control based on subscription status
- Automatic status synchronization via webhooks

### User Interface Requirements
- Subscription creation flow with payment method collection
- Subscription management dashboard
- Billing history and invoice access
- Payment method management
- Cancellation flow with retention offers

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Approach
1. Implement subscription service with Stripe integration
2. Create API endpoints for subscription management
3. Add user interface for subscription management
4. Implement payment failure handling
5. Add email notifications for subscription events
6. Test subscription lifecycle scenarios

### Key Dependencies
- EPC-16.1 (Stripe Integration) must be completed
- User authentication and authorization
- Email notification system
- Payment method management
- Service access control system

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for subscription service methods
- Integration tests with Stripe test environment
- End-to-end tests for subscription flows
- Payment failure scenario tests

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of Stripe API failures
- Retry logic for failed operations
- Data consistency between Stripe and local database
- User-friendly error messages
