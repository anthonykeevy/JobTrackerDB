### User Story JD.13 – Reward Job Logging with Gamification Points

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** to earn points when I log jobs into the platform  
**So that** I feel motivated and recognized for building out my job tracking history

---

**Description:**  
Each time a user logs a job into the platform, they receive gamification points based on the completeness of the information they submit. Logging a full job record (title, description, company, job board, URL, etc.) yields full points. Partial job logs yield proportional points. Users can see their progress on a dashboard and unlock profile badges, reinforcing positive behavior.
