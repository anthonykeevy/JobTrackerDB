# User Story CI.7: Infrastructure and Deployment

**Epic:** Core Infrastructure & Database  
**Story ID:** CI.7  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

---

## Description

As a **developer**,  
I want to **set up robust infrastructure and deployment processes**,  
So that **the platform can be reliably deployed and maintained in different environments**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Local development environment setup:
   - Docker containerization for consistent environments
   - Development database setup and seeding
   - Local API server configuration
   - Development tools and debugging setup
   - Environment-specific configuration management
   - Local testing and validation procedures

2. Production deployment architecture:
   - Cloud infrastructure setup and configuration
   - Container orchestration with Kubernetes
   - Load balancer and reverse proxy configuration
   - Database deployment and configuration
   - SSL/TLS certificate management
   - Domain and DNS configuration

3. Containerization and orchestration:
   - Docker containerization for all services
   - Kubernetes deployment manifests
   - Service discovery and load balancing
   - Health checks and readiness probes
   - Resource limits and requests
   - Rolling updates and rollback procedures

4. Monitoring and logging infrastructure:
   - Application performance monitoring (APM)
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack
   - Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
   - Error tracking and reporting
   - Metrics collection and visualization
   - Health check endpoints and monitoring

5. Backup and recovery procedures:
   - Automated backup scheduling and verification
   - Database backup and restoration procedures
   - File system backup and recovery
   - Disaster recovery procedures and testing
   - Backup retention and archival policies
   - Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO)

6. Security and compliance frameworks:
   - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Compliance monitoring and reporting
   - Access control and identity management
   - Security policy enforcement
   - Incident response procedures
   - Security audit and compliance documentation

7. CI/CD pipeline and automation:
   - Automated build and testing pipelines
   - Deployment automation and orchestration
   - Environment promotion and release management
   - Rollback and recovery automation
   - Configuration management and versioning
   - Deployment monitoring and validation
