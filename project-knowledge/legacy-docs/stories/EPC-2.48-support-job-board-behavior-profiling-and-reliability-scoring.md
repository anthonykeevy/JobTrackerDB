### User Story JD.48 – Support Job Board Behavior Profiling and Reliability Scoring

**Epic:** Job Discovery and Logging for Profile Matching  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Ready for Dev  
**Type:** Feature  

**Story:**  
As a system,  
I want to build behavior profiles for each job board and assign reliability scores,  
So that I can improve deduplication accuracy, redirection prediction, and metadata integrity across job discovery workflows.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Track job board behavior including redirection patterns, dynamic URL generation, and metadata availability.
- [ ] Calculate a “reliability score” per board based on:
  - Metadata completeness frequency
  - Redirection frequency and consistency
  - Number of false positives in deduplication logic
  - Consistency in location and company tagging
  - Recruiter transparency
- [ ] Update scores weekly and store historical values for regression monitoring.
- [ ] Expose reliability data in admin dashboard and allow overrides by moderator.
- [ ] Allow per-board reliability notes/tags (e.g., “LinkedIn redirects often”, “CompanyX careers has structured metadata”).
- [ ] Use reliability score to weight confidence in deduplication and metadata ingestion decisions.

**Dependencies:**
- Job board ingestion engine
- Deduplication metrics logger
- Metadata quality tracker
- Admin dashboard module
