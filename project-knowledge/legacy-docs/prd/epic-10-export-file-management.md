**Epic Title:** Export & File Management

**Epic Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive file export capabilities, markdown-based artifact storage, template management, and quality assurance features to ensure users can access their generated artifacts in multiple formats while maintaining data integrity and professional presentation.

**Background:**
This epic addresses the critical need for users to export their generated content (resumes, cover letters, fit score reports, analytics) in various formats for external use. The system will store all artifacts in markdown format only. For resumes, markdown is used for storage, but HTML+CSS is used to generate visually accurate exports (PDF, DOCX, HTML). Exported files are generated on demand and delivered to the user, but are not retained or stored in the system after download. This approach ensures lightweight storage, version control, and privacy, while still providing professional-quality exports.

**Key Features:**

1. **Markdown-First Artifact Storage**
   * All user-generated artifacts (resumes, cover letters, reports, etc.) are stored in markdown format only
   * Enables lightweight storage, version control, and text-based editing
   * Metadata (job ID, profile version, prompt ID, timestamp, tone) is stored with each markdown artifact

2. **Multi-Format Export Engine**
   * PDF, DOCX, and HTML exports are generated from markdown using HTML+CSS for layout fidelity (especially for resumes)
   * Exported files are not stored after downloadâ€”only the markdown source is retained
   * CSV/Excel and JSON exports for analytics and data portability are generated on demand

3. **Template Management System**
   * Professional resume templates (chronological, functional, hybrid) defined in HTML+CSS for export
   * Cover letter and report templates in markdown/HTML
   * Template customization and version control
   * Template preview and selection interface

4. **Quality Assurance and Validation**
   * Export quality validation and testing
   * Format consistency across different outputs
   * Professional presentation standards
   * Content integrity verification
   * Export preview functionality

5. **File Sharing and Collaboration**
   * Secure sharing of markdown artifacts and on-demand exports
   * Email integration for sending artifacts
   * Link-based sharing with expiration dates
   * Access control and permissions
   * Download tracking and analytics

6. **Export Customization**
   * Custom filename generation
   * Branding and styling options for exports
   * Content selection and filtering
   * Export scheduling and automation
   * Batch export capabilities
   * Export preferences and defaults
