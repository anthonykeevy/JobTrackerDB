# Profile Builder UAT Fixes

## ðŸ”§ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Salary Expectations Layout Issue** âœ…
**Problem**: The "Payment Period" field was misleading - it looked like when the user would like to be paid, but it should clarify the periodicity of the salary expectation.

**Fix**: 
- Changed label from "Payment Period" to "Salary Period"
- Added clarifying text: "(What period does your salary expectation cover?)"
- Changed "Expected Amount" to "Salary Expectation" for clarity

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProfileBuilder/steps/CareerAspirationStep.tsx`

### **2. Target Industries Made Optional** âœ…
**Problem**: Target industries were mandatory, but should be optional.

**Fix**:
- Updated validation schema to make `targetIndustries` optional
- Removed the minimum requirement of 1 industry

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProfileBuilder/steps/CareerAspirationStep.tsx`

### **3. Education GPA Field Issue** âœ…
**Problem**: GPA field was optional but causing validation issues preventing navigation to Work Experience.

**Fix**:
- Updated GPA field registration to properly handle empty values
- Added `setValueAs` function to convert empty strings to `undefined`
- This ensures the field is truly optional and doesn't block form submission

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProfileBuilder/steps/EducationStep.tsx`

### **4. Removed Certifications from Skills Step** âœ…
**Problem**: Skills step had a "Certifications" category which was redundant since certifications are already handled in the Education step.

**Fix**:
- Removed `certification` from the skill type enum
- Removed certification category from the UI
- Removed certification suggestions
- Updated description to remove mention of certifications
- Removed certification icon and category info

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProfileBuilder/steps/SkillsStep.tsx`
