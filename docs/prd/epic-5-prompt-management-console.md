**Epic Title:** Prompt Management Console

**Epic Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

**Goal:** Build an administrative console to manage, test, optimize, and audit all AI prompts used throughout the platform, ensuring alignment with feature needs, user satisfaction, and model cost-effectiveness.

**Background:**
As the platform integrates multiple AI components across resume generation, job analysis, and messaging support, each feature depends on prompts optimized for different use cases and models. To maintain quality, reduce hallucinations, and control costs, prompt governance is critical. Additionally, tracking usage by model and analyzing user feedback helps prioritize improvements. This is especially important as the system may operate across multiple LLM providers with varying costs and behavior.

**Design Considerations:**

* Each prompt must be stored with metadata:

  * ID, version, use case, tone configuration, target model(s)
  * Associated features and artifacts (e.g., resume, message, fit score)
* Admins should be able to:

  * Edit and test prompts across supported AI models
  * Preview sample inputs/outputs
  * Track satisfaction ratings and cost metrics per invocation
* Prompt storage format: markdown, versioned
* All prompt executions log token usage, response latency, and model cost
* Prompts should be version-controlled and traceable to their usage across jobs
* Markdown responses from prompts will be rendered for users and stored as artifacts
* Export fidelity (PDF/DOCX/HTML) must be preserved for all markdown-based content

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Prompt Registry & Editor**

   * Maintain prompt catalog organized by use case
   * View prompt versions and history
   * Edit/test prompts with sample data and preview model output

2. **Model-Specific Tuning**

   * Assign prompt variants to specific models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude)
   * Track performance and cost by model+prompt pair
   * Benchmark outputs across models

3. **User Feedback Integration**

   * Correlate prompt output with user satisfaction scores
   * Highlight underperforming prompts
   * Allow feedback-driven tuning decisions

4. **Audit and History Logs**

   * Log every prompt execution with:

     * Model used, timestamp, tokens in/out, cost, user feedback, associated artifact
   * View historical outputs per prompt version
   * Enable rollback to previous versions

5. **Prompt Optimization Analytics**

   * Dashboards for satisfaction score, cost per output, model ROI
   * Highlight top/bottom performers by category and feature
   * Support recommendations engine for improving prompts or switching models

**Success Metrics:**

* Reduction in prompt-related support issues or hallucinations
* Improvement in user satisfaction score per AI feature
* Cost savings from optimized promptâ€“model pairing
* Number of prompt edits based on analytics feedback
* Export fidelity consistency across markdown artifacts

**Dependencies:**

* Prompt storage and versioning system
* Token and cost tracking engine
* Model selector and test harness
* Artifact logger for markdown outputs
* Analytics and dashboarding platform
* Markdown export engine for PDF/DOCX/HTML (shared with resume and messaging features)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* All prompts are version-controlled, model-mapped, and stored in markdown
* Admins can test, preview, and export prompts and outputs
* Token usage and cost are logged per invocation
* Satisfaction data feeds into prompt quality scoring
* Prompt changes are auditable with restore capability
* Markdown-based prompt outputs preserve fidelity when exported

**Priority:** High
