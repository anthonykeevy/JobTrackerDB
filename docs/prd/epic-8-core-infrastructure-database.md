**Epic Title:** Core Infrastructure & Database

**Epic Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

**Goal:** Design and implement the foundational database schema, API architecture, backend services, and infrastructure components to support all platform features while ensuring scalability, security, and performance.

**Background:**
This epic establishes the core technical foundation for the platform, including the database schema design, API architecture, backend services, and infrastructure components. The system must support user authentication, profile management, job logging, fit scoring, resume generation, gamification, and analytics while maintaining data integrity, security, and performance. The architecture should be designed for scalability and future enhancements.

**Key Features:**

1. **Database Schema Design**
   * Comprehensive database schema for all platform entities
   * User management and authentication tables
   * Profile and skill management tables
   * Job logging and application tracking tables
   * Gamification and analytics tables
   * Audit logging and security tables
   * Proper relationships, constraints, and indexing
   * Consistent naming conventions: `JobTrackerDB` database, `dbo` schema, singular table names (e.g., `Profile`, `User`), hierarchical naming for related tables (e.g., `ProfileSkill`, `JobApplication`), auto-incrementing `[TableName]ID` primary keys, `v_` prefix for views, `s_` prefix for stored procedures, `nvarchar` for Unicode text fields

2. **API Architecture and Endpoints**
   * RESTful API design with proper HTTP methods
   * Authentication and authorization endpoints
   * Profile management endpoints
   * Job logging and discovery endpoints
   * Fit scoring and analytics endpoints
   * Resume and artifact generation endpoints
   * Gamification and user engagement endpoints

3. **Backend Services Architecture**
   * FastAPI-based backend with Python
   * Modular service architecture
   * Authentication and session management
   * Data validation and sanitization
   * Error handling and logging
   * Performance optimization and caching
   * Security and encryption services

4. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**
   * Custom MCP service for database operations
   * Centralized data access layer
   * Permission validation and access control
   * Audit logging for all database operations
   * Data validation and business logic enforcement
   * Support for future client integrations

5. **Data Security and Privacy**
   * Data encryption at rest and in transit
   * User data privacy and GDPR compliance
   * Secure authentication and session management
   * Access control and permission management
   * Audit logging for security events
   * Data backup and disaster recovery

6. **Performance and Scalability**
   * Database optimization and indexing
   * Caching strategies and implementation
   * Query optimization and monitoring
   * Load balancing and horizontal scaling
   * Performance monitoring and alerting
   * Resource management and optimization

7. **Infrastructure and Deployment**
   * Local development environment setup
   * Production deployment architecture
   * Containerization and orchestration
   * Monitoring and logging infrastructure
   * Backup and recovery procedures
   * Security and compliance frameworks

**Success Metrics:**
* Database performance and query response times
* API response times and throughput
* System uptime and reliability
* Security incident rates
* Data integrity and consistency
* Scalability and resource utilization
* Development velocity and deployment frequency
* Error rates and system stability

**Dependencies:**
* Authentication system requirements (Epic 7)
* Profile intake flow requirements (Epic 1)
* Job discovery and logging requirements (Epic 2)
* Fit score analysis requirements (Epic 3)
* Resume tailoring requirements (Epic 4)
* Dashboard analytics requirements (Epic 9)
* Export and file management requirements (Epic 10)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* Database schema supports all platform features efficiently
* API endpoints are secure, performant, and well-documented
* Backend services are modular, maintainable, and scalable
* MCP integration provides centralized data access and security
* Data security and privacy requirements are met
* Performance meets or exceeds defined SLAs
* Infrastructure supports local development and production deployment
* System is resilient to failures and provides proper error handling
* Monitoring and logging provide comprehensive system visibility
* Documentation is complete and up-to-date
