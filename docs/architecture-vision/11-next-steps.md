# 11. Next Steps

- Finalize this Architecture Vision document with self-review.
    
- Set up the local development environment this week with FastAPI, local MSSQL Server, and a Git repository, including a data logging table (Analytics) and tables for Profile (Profile) and user domains (User) with triggers for profile updates, job applications, fit score requests, and campaign interactions, all under the dbo schema.
    
- Begin development following the 3-month MVP plan:
    
    - **Month 1**: Core features (profile creation, job application tracking) and database setup with analytics table, using local automation to streamline tasks.
        
    - **Month 2**: AI integration for custom resumes, cover letters, and messages (up to five free, unlimited with $10/month); testing locally.
        
    - **Month 3**: Basic gamification, prepare for local launch with free tier and $10/month subscription, and limited support (fit score, job logging) for non-paying users, with plans to transition to Azure.
        
- Record future ideas (e.g., company-paid model for hiring, internal talent discovery) in a Phase E document.
    
- **Development Support Strategies**: Leverage guidance for task prioritization (e.g., starting with profile creation and job tracking), automate infrastructure setup with local scripts (e.g., PowerShell for MSSQL), and use scaffolding tools for FastAPI and frontend code to reduce manual effort.
