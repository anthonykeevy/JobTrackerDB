# PM.3 - Prompt Testing Playground

## Goal
Provide an interactive sandbox environment where administrators can test prompts across different models using sample inputs, preview outputs, and record performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admins can select a prompt version and choose an AI model (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Sample input fields simulate real user data (e.g., resume content, job description)
- Sandbox execution runs the prompt and displays model output in real time
- Side-by-side view to compare prompt performance across models
- Test results include:
  - Output content
  - Token usage and calculated cost
  - Response time
  - Model version used
- Admins can rate the output or flag for review
- Test session results are logged and stored for performance analysis
- Ability to export or share test run history for review
