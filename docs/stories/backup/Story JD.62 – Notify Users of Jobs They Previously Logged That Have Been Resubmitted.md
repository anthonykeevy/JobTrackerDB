### User Story JD.62 â€“ Notify Users of Jobs They Previously Logged That Have Been Resubmitted

**Epic:** Job Discovery and Logging for Profile Matching  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Ready for Dev  
**Type:** Engagement & Matching Feature  

**Story:**  
As a system,  
I want to notify users when a job they previously viewed or applied to is resubmitted or relisted,  
So that they can consider reapplying or updating their profile for a better fit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detect when a previously logged job reappears on a job board (with updated posting date or structure).
- [ ] Compare relisted job against previously stored versions for matching (title, company, location, description).
- [ ] If match confidence exceeds threshold:
  - [ ] Notify all users who interacted with the earlier version.
  - [ ] Indicate the changes in job description or metadata (if any).
  - [ ] Optionally prompt user to update profile or artifact for a renewed fit score.
- [ ] Track interactions with resubmitted job versions (viewed, reapplied, ignored).
- [ ] Award gamification points for prompt response or relogging.

**Dependencies:**
- Job deduplication and version tracking engine
- Notification system
- Profile update and artifact modules
- Fit score recalculation pipeline
- Gamification reward system
