### User Story JD.60 â€“ Incentivize User-Driven Job Listing Verification and Flagging

**Epic:** Job Discovery and Logging for Profile Matching  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Ready for Dev  
**Type:** Engagement Feature  

**Story:**  
As a system,  
I want to encourage users to help verify the status and accuracy of job listings they've logged or interacted with,  
So that the job data remains current and trustworthy, while promoting gamified engagement.

  - [ ] Or mark as no longer available
- [ ] Reward users with gamification points for each verified check.

- [ ] Maintain an audit log of who verified what and when.
