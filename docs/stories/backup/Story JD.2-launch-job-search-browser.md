### User Story JD.2 – Launch Job Search Browser

**As a** job seeker  
**I want** to launch a guided browser session from a selected job board  
**So that** I can browse job listings and allow the system to track and assist with job data logging

---

**Description:**  
Upon selecting a job board from the curated list, the system should initiate a browser session (e.g., Playwright-driven or embedded WebView) that enables the user to browse job listings. The session must track user navigation steps, capturing URLs and page transitions for traceability. The browser interface should include lightweight UI aids to assist with identifying and logging job opportunities (e.g., "Log this Job" button).

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Selecting a job board launches a new browser session with the board’s homepage
- [ ] Browser session is tracked and all visited URLs are logged for session traceability
- [ ] The system identifies and highlights job listing pages
- [ ] User can manually initiate job logging with an action button
- [ ] Navigation chain is stored alongside any job that is eventually logged
- [ ] If redirected to another board (e.g., corporate page), redirection is recorded and new site metadata is linked

---

**Dependencies:**
- Playwright or equivalent headless/full-browser automation framework
- Navigation telemetry capture
- Job board metadata and launch framework (from JD.1)
- UI overlay or plugin for logging prompts

**Priority:** High  
**Tags:** browser-launch, telemetry, job-discovery, traceability, guided-experience
