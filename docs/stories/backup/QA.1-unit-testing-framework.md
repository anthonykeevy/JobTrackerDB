# QA.1: Unit Testing Framework

**Epic:** Epic 12 â€“ Testing & Quality Assurance

**As a** developer working on the platform,  
I want to **have comprehensive unit tests for all code components**,  
So that **I can ensure code quality, catch bugs early, and maintain confidence in code changes**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Backend unit testing setup:
   - Python unit testing framework (pytest) configuration
   - Test database setup with isolated test data
   - Mocking framework for external dependencies
   - Test fixtures and helper functions
   - Test environment configuration

2. API endpoint testing:
   - All API endpoints have unit tests
   - Request/response validation testing
   - Error handling and edge case testing
   - Authentication and authorization testing
   - Input validation and sanitization testing

3. Database layer testing:
   - Database model unit tests
   - Query optimization testing
   - Transaction handling testing
   - Data integrity constraint testing
   - Migration testing

4. Service layer testing:
   - Business logic unit tests
   - AI service integration testing (mocked)
   - Email service testing (mocked)
   - Gamification engine testing
   - Notification service testing

5. Frontend component testing:
   - React Testing Library setup
   - Component rendering tests
   - User interaction testing
   - State management testing
   - Props and event handling testing

6. Test coverage reporting:
   - Code coverage measurement and reporting
   - Coverage thresholds and quality gates
   - Coverage trend analysis
   - Uncovered code identification
   - Coverage improvement recommendations

7. Test data management:
   - Test data factories and builders
   - Isolated test data sets
   - Test data cleanup procedures
   - Realistic test scenarios
   - Performance test data sets

8. Test execution and reporting:
   - Fast test execution with parallelization
   - Clear test failure reporting
   - Test result aggregation
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Test execution metrics

## Definition of Done

- All critical code paths have unit tests
- Test coverage meets established thresholds (>80%)
- Tests execute quickly and reliably
- Test failures provide clear debugging information
- Mocking is used appropriately for external dependencies
- Test data is properly managed and isolated
- Coverage reporting is accurate and actionable
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline is complete
