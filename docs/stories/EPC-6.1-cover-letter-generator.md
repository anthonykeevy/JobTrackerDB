As a job seeker, I want to generate a customized cover letter aligned with a specific job description and my profile so that I can submit a complete and compelling application.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can select a job from their job log and a corresponding profile version.

- Cover letter is rendered in markdown format and editable.

- Filename follows structured convention: `[FullName]_[JobTitle]_CoverLetter_[Company]_[YYYYMMDD-HHMM].pdf`.
- User feedback (rating) is captured post-preview or export.

## Out of Scope:
