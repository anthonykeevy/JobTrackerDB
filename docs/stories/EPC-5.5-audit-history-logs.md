# PM.5 - Audit and History Logs

## Goal
Ensure that every AI prompt interaction is fully logged with traceable metadata, version history, and cost metrics to support transparency, rollback, and optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All prompt executions are logged with:
  - Prompt ID and version
  - Model used
  - Input context hash or summary
  - Timestamp
  - User ID or session reference
  - Token usage (input/output)
  - Calculated cost
- Audit logs include:
  - Triggering feature/component
  - Output preview (if privacy allows)
  - Satisfaction rating (if given)
- Logs are queryable by prompt, model, user, time range, or feature
- Admins can restore a prompt to any historical version via log reference
- Critical events (e.g., failed executions, fallback triggers) are flagged
- Audit interface includes export function (CSV, JSON)
