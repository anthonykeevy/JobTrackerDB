# FE.3: Component Library and Design System

**Epic:** Epic 13 â€“ Frontend Architecture & UI/UX

**As a** developer building the platform,  
I want to **have a comprehensive component library with consistent design patterns**,  
So that **I can build interfaces quickly and maintain design consistency across the application**.
