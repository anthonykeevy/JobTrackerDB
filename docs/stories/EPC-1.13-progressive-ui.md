**Epic:** Unified Career Profile Intake for Resume Generation  
**Story ID:** 3.4  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Revised  
**Owner:** Product Owner (PO)

---

## Description

As a **user**,  
I want **the interface to adapt based on my experience level and selected role complexity**,  
So that **I'm only shown fields and prompts that are relevant to me at the right time**

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System adapts profile intake fields based on:
   - Career stage (student, early-career, mid/senior)
   - Target role (individual contributor, specialist, leadership)
   - Resume content if available
2. Low-priority or optional fields are hidden until user shows interest or indicates relevance.
3. UI progressively reveals:
   - Detailed fields when high-level input is complete
   - Advanced modules (e.g., achievements, long-term aspirations) as user progresses
4. User always retains control to expand sections manually.
5. Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
6. AI assistant honors progressive UI visibility in its guidance and suggestions.
