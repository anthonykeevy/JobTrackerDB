# PM.4 - User Feedback Integration

## Goal
Capture user sentiment after AI-assisted interactions to assess prompt effectiveness, improve model–prompt alignment, and drive continuous improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users are prompted to rate the usefulness of AI-generated content (e.g., thumbs up/down or 1–5 rating scale)
- Each feedback instance logs:
  - Prompt ID and version
  - Model used
  - Input context (e.g., JD, profile section, resume bullet)
  - Timestamp and user session
- Admins can view aggregated feedback trends:
  - By prompt
  - By model
  - By feature/component
- Feedback data linked to prompt registry to display satisfaction score per version
- Admins can filter feedback dashboard by:
  - Time range
  - User segment
  - Prompt category or tag
- Low-rated prompts trigger alerts or appear in “underperforming” panel
- Admins can export feedback data for external analysis

`user-feedback`, `prompt-evaluation`, `ai-sentiment-tracking`, `satisfaction-scoring`, `admin-insight`, `feedback-analytics`

## Dependencies
