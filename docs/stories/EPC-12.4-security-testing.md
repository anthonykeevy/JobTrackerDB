# QA.4: Security Testing

**Epic:** Epic 12 â€“ Testing & Quality Assurance

**As a** security-conscious platform owner,  
I want to **ensure the platform is secure and protects user data**,  
So that **users can trust the platform with their sensitive career and personal information**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Authentication and authorization testing:
   - User registration and login security
   - Password strength and validation
   - Multi-factor authentication (future)
   - Session management and timeout
   - Role-based access control validation
   - Account lockout and recovery

2. API security testing:
   - API endpoint authentication validation
   - Authorization token verification
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - API versioning security
   - CORS and cross-origin security

3. Data protection testing:
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Personal data anonymization and pseudonymization
   - Data retention and deletion compliance
   - Backup security and encryption
   - Data export security
   - GDPR and privacy regulation compliance

4. Vulnerability testing:
   - SQL injection prevention testing
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
   - Command injection prevention
   - File upload security validation
   - Directory traversal prevention

5. Third-party integration security:
   - OpenAI API security and token protection
   - Email service security
   - External job board API security
   - Payment processing security (future)
   - Service-to-service authentication

6. Security monitoring and logging:
   - Security event logging and monitoring
   - Intrusion detection and prevention
   - Security alert system
   - Audit trail completeness
   - Security incident response testing

7. Privacy and compliance testing:
   - Privacy policy compliance validation
   - User consent management testing
   - Data subject rights implementation
   - Cookie and tracking compliance
   - Third-party data sharing controls

8. Penetration testing:
   - External vulnerability assessment
   - Internal security testing
   - Social engineering resistance
   - Physical security considerations
   - Security configuration review
