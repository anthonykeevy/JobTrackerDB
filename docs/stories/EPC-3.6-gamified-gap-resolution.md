# FS.6 - Gamified Gap Resolution and Progress Points

## Goal
Encourage user engagement and continuous profile refinement by awarding points and milestones for addressing skill gaps and improving fit scores.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users receive points when:
  - Confirming skill presence/absence during fit score review
  - Accepting or rejecting AI-suggested skills
  - Adding or editing profile skills to close gaps
  - Completing learning roadmap items tied to gap resolution
- Points contribute to a visible progress tracker or badge system
- Users unlock milestones for cumulative actions (e.g., “First 5 gaps resolved,” “First +10 fit score delta”)
- Gamification system supports role-specific goal alignment (e.g., tech vs. marketing career tracks)
- Fit improvement events are timestamped and viewable in a progress log
- Users can share milestones or badges externally (optional)
- Gamified elements are shown in context (e.g., “+20 points for resolving 2 skills” during fit score update)
- Admins can configure reward thresholds and actions
